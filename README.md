# OpenSearch Load Tester (AMOS WS 2025)

The **OpenSearch Load Tester** is a tool designed to evaluate the performance limits of a single OpenSearch instance. It consists of two separate Spring Boot projects:

- **Test Manager** - Responsible for configuring, orchestrating and managing test scenarios.
- **Load Generator** - Executes the actual load by sending parallel queries against an OpenSearch instance.
